PHP OOPs Roadmap (Basic → Advanced)

What is OOP?
    - OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a way of structuring code using objects that contain data (properties) and behavior (methods).
    Why OOP?
    - Code reusability
    - Maintainability
    - Security
    - Scalability

Class & Object (Foundation)
    - Class = Blueprint (Design)
        Like:
            House drawing
            Car design

    - Object = Instance of a class
        Like:
            Ram is a human
            Sita is a human

$this ?
    - $this means current object

Constructor (Auto Start) ?
    - Constructor runs automatically when object is created
